## Background
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Climate change is a big problem not only for local areas, but for the whole planet on a global scale. As pollutants accumulate in our atmosphere, the so-called greenhouse effect causes global warming, which leads to climate change. Through the last decade humanity realized the importance of climate change and started to react to the levels of greenhouse emissions.


## The scope of study
This study examines the influence of economic growth on environmental
degradation. It is well known that CO2 is one of the worst pollutants contributing to environmental issues (Houghton, 1996). This project was chosen to understand the relationship between GDP growth and CO2 (one of greenhouse gasses) emissions rate for the different countries and regions with the potential to observe the trend each country has.

We would like to split our analyses into three different stages:

### Worldwide level analysis:
At this stage we wish to analyze the general CO2 emission distribution and how it has changed globally throughout history, relationship analyses with GDP growth. Specific questions:
1. What's the global distribution pattern of
CO2 emission? How does it change
throughout history?
2. Is there a correlation between GDP
growth rate and emission rate?

### Critical time point analysis:
At this stage, we intended to investigate the critical time point that may change the global CO2 emission and socio-economic status from 1989-2020.
Specific questions:
1. How does the change of economic
status influence the CO2 emission pattern during the depression around 2008?
2. How do countries respond to the Paris Agreement?
3. How do countries respond to the COVID-19?

### Country-focus analysis:
At this stage, we intended to study a particular country or group of similar countries and analyze their CO2 emissions and economic patterns throughout history.


## Dataset
The primary dataset used in this study is provided by Ourworldindata.org. This dataset is built upon several other datasets and processing steps (BP, EIA, Global Carbon Project, CAIT datasets). 

Secondary dataset: World Energy Consumption dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. 

Third dataset: GDP data is gathered from the World Bank.

Fourth dataset: World-countries geojason dataset, with country geometries

## Results
The hypothesized correlation between GDP rate and CO2 emissions rate is observed for majority of countries.

However, some countries shows negative correlation, like Venezuela, Oman and others. During economic recession in 2008, when GDP dropped down, CO2 emission rate went down as well.

Overall, changes in CO2 emissions in global events were prominent in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. Relatively, the changes were not significant in Asia and Africa. Comparing to other critical time point, no significant changes were observed in Paris Agreement period.

Among the categories, most countries develop their economies and increase their annual CO2 emissions. This correlation is most pronounced in Guinea, Bangladesh, Cambodia and others. The number of these categories reflects the global dependence of development on fossil energy sources. Meanwhile, many countries have managed to cut CO2 emissions while maintaining GDP growth, such as Cuba and Malta. Countries such as Greece, Italy and Japan have decided to cut CO2 emissions, but at the same time their economies are in recession. And finally, some countries, including Iran, Sudan and Tunisia, unfortunately did not achieve an economic recovery, and CO2 emissions increased.
